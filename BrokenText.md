# Unturned- Broken text error

 If you have joined a server, that has too many placards/signs/flags with a lot of text on them in a specific area you might experience the broken text error. That error will cause some of the text written on the placards/signs/flags to either turn into some weird shapes or even disappear. Sometimes that affects all text including the in-game chat and the main menu.

## Solution

A simple way to fix the broken text is to just leave the area that has too many placards/signs/flags. You can also either destroy them or remove some of the text written on them to prevent that area from causing this bug.
